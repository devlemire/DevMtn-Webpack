# DevMtn-Webpack

## Step 1
### Summary
In this repository we are going to go over how to create a React application from scratch using webpack. To start using webpack we should install it globally using npm so we can have access to it's CLI commands.
### Detailed Instructions
Using a terminal window we can globally install webpack by typing `sudo npm install -g webpack`.

## Step 2
### Summary
Now that webpack is globally installed you won't have to worry about doing it again, it will stay globally installed. In order to start creating our application we're going to make a package.json file to keep track of our dependencies. 
### Detailed Instructions
Using a terminal window and being in the root folder of the project run `npm init`. Npm init runs us through creating a package.json file so we don't have to type it from scratch. Majority of the time you can just hold enter and take all the default values. In this case we'll have to change the name since capital letters are not allowed.

## Step 3
### Summary
With package.json created we can install packages and use either `--save` or `--save-dev` to save our dependencies into development dependencies or 'regular' dependencies. This allows developers to run `npm install` when in the root of your project to install all the required dependencies.
### Detailed Instructions
Even though we've installed webpack globally, we'll still need to install it into our repository. In addition to webpack we'll need the following extensions:

* babel-core
* babel-loader
* babel-preset-es2015
* babel-preset-react 
* html-webpack-plugin

We can install all of these using one command in our terminal window. Make sure your terminal is in the same directory as package.json and run: `npm install webpack babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react html-webpack-plugin --save-dev`.

}

## Step 4
### Summary
We now have all the dependencies we need to create a React app using webpack and es6. To start configuring webpack we need to create a `webpack.config.js`.

### Detailed Instructions
Create a file in the root of the project called `webpack.config.js` and open it. In order to start creating our webpack config we have to export our module using:

````js
module.exports = {

}
````

There are 3 main parts to a webpack config: entry, module, and output. Entry tells webpack where to start, it should always point to the main app component of your React application. If we look at our current file structure our app.js is in `src/app.js`.

````js
module.exports = {
	entry: [
		'./src/app.js'
	]
}
````

Module is an object that takes a loaders property. This is where we tell webpack which files to watch for and how to convert them.

````js
module.exports = {
	entry: [
		'./src/app.js'
	],
	module: {
		loaders: [
			{ test: /\.(js|jsx)$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: 'babel-loader' }
		]
	}
}
````

The test property is regex saying "look for all files ending in js or jsx". The exclude is so that webpack doesn't go into each js/jsx file in our node_modules. And our loader is specified as babel-loader.

Output is how we tell webpack where to take our compiled files and what to name that file.

````js
module.exports = {
	entry: [
		'./src/app.js'
	],
	module: {
		loaders: [
			{ test: /\.(js|jsx)$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: 'babel-loader' }
		]
	},
	output: {
		filename: 'bundle.js',
		path: __dirname + '/public'
	}
}
````

In addition to the three main components of a webpack config we are going to be using a plugin called `html-webpack-plugin`. This plugin automatically adds a script tag linked to our outputted `bundle.js` inside of our index.html.

````js
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
var HTMLWebpackPluginConfig = new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
	template: './src/index.html',
	filename: 'index.html',
	inject: 'body'
});
````

Template should take our already created index.html (./src/index.html) so that we don't lose our div with the id of app, filename is what to name the outputted file, and inject tells the plugin where to add the script tag.

The final piece is to include a plugins property in your `webpack.config.js` and add our variable `HTMLWebpackPluginConfig`.

````js
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
var HTMLWebpackPluginConfig = new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
	template: './src/index.html',
	filename: 'index.html',
	inject: 'body'
});

module.exports = {
	entry: [
		'./src/app.js'
	],
	module: {
		loaders: [
			{ test: /\.(js|jsx)$/, exclude: /node_modules/, loader: 'babel-loader' }
		]
	},
	output: {
		filename: 'bundle.js',
		path: __dirname + '/public'
	},
	plugins: [HTMLWebpackPluginConfig]
}
````

## Step 5
### Summary
In order for our babel-loader to work correctly we need to tell it which loaders to use. We can accomplish this by specifying what loaders we want to use in a special '.babelrc' file in the root of our project.

### Detailed Instructions
Create a file named `.babelrc` in the root of the project. Our configuration file is going to be an object with a "presets" property.

````js
{
	"presets": [
		"es2015",
		"react"
	]
}
````

Our babel loader will now accept jsx and es6.

## Step 6
### Summary
You now have a working environment to create a React application using webpack. To test to make sure everything is working correclty we are going to create a React component in app.js.

### Detailed Instructions
To begin using React we need to `npm install react react-dom --save`. This will put these dependencies outside our development dependencies.

  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^15.4.2",
    "react-dom": "^15.4.2"
  }
}
````
</details>

Using es6 we can import `react` and `react-dom` to our app.js

````js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
````

After importing we can create our App class that renders "Hello world".

````js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class App extends React.Component {
	constructor() {
		super();
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<p> Hello World </p>
			</div>
		)
	}
}
````

And finally render it on the DOM using ReactDOM.

````js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class App extends React.Component {
	constructor() {
		super();
	}

	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				<p> Hello World </p>
			</div>
		)
	}
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
````

### Solution
Open or live-server index.html in `./public/index.html`
